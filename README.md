# GithubAPICodeTesting

Here are the code file I made:

CSS - Content/Site.css
JS - Scripts/githubAPI.js
html - Views/Home/Index.cshtml
Bootstrap - Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml


PLATFORM: ASP.NET Framework MVC
I do create a MVC but function is based on JQuery and html
Will think about how to improve it with pure MVC techniques

TECHNOLOGIES: JQuery, C#, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS

Thnaks for reviewing :D
