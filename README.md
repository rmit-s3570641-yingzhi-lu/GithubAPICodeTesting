# GithubAPICodeTesting

Here are the code files I have made:  

<li>CSS - Content/Site.css</li>
<li>JS - Scripts/githubAPI.js</li>
<li>html - Views/Home/Index.cshtml</li>
<li>Bootstrap - Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</li>

## PLATFORM: ASP.NET Framework MVC  

## TECHNOLOGIES: JQuery, C#, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS  

I do create a MVC but function is based on JQuery and html  

Will think about how to improve it with pure MVC techniques  

Thanks for reviewing :D
